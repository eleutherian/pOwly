##What the heck is a pOwly?

pOwly gets it's name from the [Pernambuco Pygmy Owl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernambuco_pygmy_owl)

We want to dedicate each application to an endangered species. Owls are usually associated with knowledge and wisdom which makes them good candidates for our maskot!
